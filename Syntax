Distinguish between [ ], which are to be typed, and -
 , which indicate optional arguments.
Options
reps(#) is required—it specifies the number of replications to be performed.
nodots and dots(#) specify whether to display replication dots. By default, one dot character is
displayed for each successful replication. A red ‘x’ is displayed if command returns an error or if
any value in exp list is missing. You can also control whether dots are displayed using set dots;
see [R] set.
nodots suppresses display of the replication dots.
dots(#) displays dots every # replications. dots(0) is a synonym for nodots.
noisily requests that any output from command be displayed. This option implies the nodots
option.
