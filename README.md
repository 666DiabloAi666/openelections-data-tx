OpenElections Data TX
=====================

Pre-processed election results for Texas. These CSV files are converted from [original source files](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-sources-tx) from individual counties. You can refer to the below table for overall progress. Elections marked as `done` have all counties completed for that level. Those marked as `working` mean that at least one volunteer is working on this election, and this could be a good place to start if you're new. `Not started` means that this election is wide open and could use a volunteer.
