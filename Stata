Description
simulate eases the programming task of performing Monte Carlo–type simulations. Typing
. simulate exp list, reps(#): command
runs command for # replications and collects the results in exp list.
command defines the command that performs one simulation. Most Stata commands and user-
written programs can be used with simulate, as long as they follow standard Stata syntax; see
[U] 11 Language syntax. The by prefix may not be part of command.
exp list specifies the expression to be calculated from the execution of command. If no expressions
are given, exp list assumes a default, depending upon whether command changes results in e() or
r(). If command changes results in e(), the default is b. If command changes results in r() (but
not e()), the default is all the scalars posted to r(). It is an error not to specify an expression in
exp list otherwise.
Quick start
Simple program for use with simulate
Define program myreg to generate data and fit a linear regression
program myreg, eclass
drop _all
set obs 25
generate x = rnormal()
generate y = 3*x + 1 + rnormal()
regress y x
end
Perform simulation
Record coefficients and SEs from 1,000 simulated replications of program myreg
simulate _b _se, reps(1000): myreg
As above, and set random-number seed to 5,762 for reproducible results
simulate _b _se, reps(1000) seed(5762): myreg
